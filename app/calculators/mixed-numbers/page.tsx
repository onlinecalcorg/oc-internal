      question: "What is a mixed number?",
      answer:
        "A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction. For example, 2 3/4 represents 2 whole units plus 3/4 of a unit.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you convert a mixed number to an improper fraction?",
      answer:
        "To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction: 1) Multiply the whole number by the denominator, 2) Add the result to the numerator, 3) Put this sum over the original denominator. For example, 2 3/4 = ((2 Ã— 4) + 3)/4 = 11/4.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you convert an improper fraction to a mixed number?",
      answer:
        "To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number: 1) Divide the numerator by the denominator, 2) The quotient becomes the whole number, 3) The remainder becomes the new numerator, 4) Keep the same denominator. For example, 11/4 = 2 3/4.",

      question: "How do you add mixed numbers?",
      answer:
        "To add mixed numbers: 1) Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction, 2) Find a common denominator if needed, 3) Add the numerators while keeping the same denominator, 4) Simplify the result and convert back to a mixed number if needed.",

      <p>
        The Mixed Numbers Calculator is a powerful tool for performing arithmetic operations with mixed numbers and
        fractions. Whether you're a student learning about fractions, a teacher creating math problems, or someone
        working on a project that requires precise measurements, this calculator provides accurate results with detailed
        step-by-step solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>Features of the Mixed Numbers Calculator</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with mixed numbers</li>
        <li>Convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions</li>
        <li>View detailed step-by-step solutions for every calculation</li>
        <li>Automatically simplifies fractions to their lowest terms</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface with clear input fields</li>
        <li>Works with positive and negative numbers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Mixed Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        A mixed number consists of a whole number part and a proper fraction part. For example, 2 3/4 represents 2 whole
        units plus 3/4 of a unit. Mixed numbers are commonly used in everyday measurements, recipes, and construction
        projects because they're often easier to visualize than improper fractions.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Applications</h3>
      <p>Mixed numbers are frequently used in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cooking and baking recipes (e.g., 1 1/2 cups of flour)</li>
        <li>Construction and woodworking (e.g., 2 3/4 inches)</li>
        <li>Educational settings when teaching fractions</li>
        <li>Music notation for time signatures</li>
        <li>Distance measurements (e.g., 3 1/2 miles)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mathematical Background</h3>
      <p>
        When performing operations with mixed numbers, we typically convert them to improper fractions first, perform
        the operation, and then convert the result back to a mixed number if needed. This calculator handles all these
        steps automatically and shows you the process.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
      <p>To use the Mixed Numbers Calculator:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the operation you want to perform (add, subtract, multiply, or divide)</li>
        <li>Enter the whole number, numerator, and denominator for each mixed number</li>
        <li>Click "Calculate" to see the result</li>
        <li>Review the step-by-step solution to understand the calculation process</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can also use the converter tabs to switch between mixed numbers and improper fractions.</p>
